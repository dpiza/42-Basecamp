### About 42

42 is a global education initiative that proposes a new way of learning technology: no teachers, no classrooms, students learning from their fellow students (peer to peer learning), with a methodology that develops both computing and life skills. The 42 cursus is free for whoever is approved in its selection process. 

### Basecamp

The Basecamp is a 20-day C programming online bootcamp, and is the last stage in the selection process for becoming a "cadet" (42's student). During this immersion, the campers have the opportunity to live 42's learning methodology and culture.
It is also one of the best experiences I've ever had.
